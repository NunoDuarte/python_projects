# MonteCarloSim

This is a repository for my work related to Monte Carlo Simulations

What am I doing now:
-----------

Learning what is Monte Carlo Simulation and what it is for. Also, following the tutorials from 'sentdex' YouTube channel

Some Notes about the Monte Carlo Simulation:
----------------------------------------

You can use the Monte Carlo to calculate for you the value of Pi without knowing it. If you have the perimeter of a circle and its radius you can ask Monte Carlo to find the value with a 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 error that gives you the correct value of the perimeter.

This and many other examples could be solved using the Monte Carlo Simulation!
