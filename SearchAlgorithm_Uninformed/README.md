# SearchAlgorithm
Search Algorithm for the best route

This is Python (version 3.5) code for 3 Search Algorithms.
The objective is given a client that wants to go from city A to city B, and with some personal preferences (doesn't want to go buy plain, or it want the fastest journey).

The 3 Search Algorithms are:
  Uninformed Search Algorithm:
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  
  Informed Search Algorithm:
  - A* Algorithm 

-------------//--------------

You give a input.map file with all the different connections between 2 cities;

cityA TypeofTransport cityB duration cost Ti Tf Intervals

Ti = time instant of the rst depart on each day
Tf = time instant after which there are no more departures
Intervals = daily periodicity

You give a input.cli with all the clients that want the best route corresponding to his/her specifications;

i cityA cityB Ti criteria number A typeA B typeB

i = the number of clients
two integer numbers identifying the initial (typeA) and final cities (typeB) ;
Ti = a non-negative integer number representing the time instant after which the client is available to travel;
criteria =  'tempo' or 'custo'; What does the client wants to optimize
number = the number of constraints (0, 1 or 2)

A typeA:
- a pair of two elements, where the rst can be A1, A2 or A3, and the second can be aviao, comboio, autocarro or barco if the first is A1 or an integer number if the rst is either A2 or A3;

B typeB:
- a pair of two more elements composed by one of the words B1 or B2, followed by an integer number.

Run Program:

python istravel.py input.map input.cli

Output File:

- the client number, the determined route, the total time and the total cost. The total time is the difference between the arrival time instant to the final city and the time instant after which the client is available to travel (see definition in the .cli file). The total cost is just the sum of the costs of all connections used in the route.
- the route specication mentioned above should follow the following rules: starts with the number of the initial city, and ends with the number of the nal city. In between, you must insert for each connection of the route two elements: the type of transport (aviao, comboio, barco or autocarro) and the number of the next city, all separated by a blank space.
- if there is no possible route for a particular client, the corresponding row should have only the client 
number and -ô€€€1.
